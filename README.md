I didn't want to submit the project like this, but I couldn't find a solution to the errors I encountered, so I'm sending what I've done at least until the part that is working.
Things that you can do:
1-It asks for your name and age before starting the game.
2-You can explore around 5x5 map
3-If you step on somewhere important informs you
4-If there is any item where you step on also informs you
5-There is 3 different locations 

If I could have handled the inventory system smoothly, I would have created an NPC for interaction and finish the game. However, since interactions with the NPC  depending on the owned items, I couldn't complete the project.
Thank you, have a great day.
